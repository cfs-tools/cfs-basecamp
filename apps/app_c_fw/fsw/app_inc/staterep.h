**
**  Purpose:
**    Define a class that provides a mechanism for objects to report boolean
**    states represented by a single bit that are aggregated into an app state
**    report packet.
**
**  Notes:
**    1. This code was originally acquired from the NASA cFS External Code
**       Interface (ECI) NOSA release and that was named FaultRep because it
**       was exicitly used to report faults using one bit for each fault
**       which made it very easy to configure Limit Checker to logically
**       combine faults. It has been generalized to be a boolean state
**       reporter and it remains functionally very similar.
**    2. This code must be reentrant and no global data can be used. 
**    3. STATEREP_Constructor() must be called prior to any other STATEREP_ 
**       functions
**    4. The telemetry generation requires that an even number of state
**       16-bit state words be defined.
**    5. This object does not associate any meaning to the state bit IDs.
**    6. Typically multiple state definition points are "ORed" together to
**       an meta-state especially when states represents faults. For example,
**       if fault A or fault B occur then take corrective action X. This
**       utility assumes the combining of state definition points is 
**       performed by the received of this utility's telemetry packet.
**    7. The ReportMode flag has the following definitions
**       - STATEREP_NEW_REPORT - The ID notifications for an app's current
**         execution cycle are copied into the message.
**       - STATEREP_MERGE_REPORT - The ID notifications for an app's current
**         execution cycle are merged(logically ORed) with the message
**    8. STATEREP_BIT_ID_MAX must be defined prior to including this header.
