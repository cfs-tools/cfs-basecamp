This demo command sequence serves as a template for user command scripts. Command
sequences are a list of commands that are individually sent by the user.  Command
sequences are useful when teaching how to perform an operational function.  The 
user can control the operational flow and observe the flight software responses.
The command parameters are hardcoded because sequences are written to support a 
specific lesson. 

This file’s syntax is simple. Lines beginning with a ‘>’ are commands that can be
sent by the user. These lines are extracted from the file and presented to the user
in a scrollable window where they send each command. Each command line can have a
comment that starts with a ‘#’ character.  Command comments are displayed in a second
window when the command is highlighted. Comments should help the user understand
expected behavior and which telemetry points to use to verify the command behaved as
expected. 

Command Line syntax: > App_Name, Command, {dictionary of parameters} ## Comment

Only lines starting with ">" are interpreted so all other lines are treated as
file comments.

'##' can't be part of a command or contained in a comment. It can only be used to start
a comment.
