This demo command sequence serves as a template for user command scripts. Command
sequences are a list of commands that are individually sent by the user. They are
a substitute for command scripts that would send commands and provide mechanisms
for automated command execution verification using telemetry. 

This demo command sequence serves as a template for user command scripts. Command
sequences are a list of commands that are individually sent by the user.  Command
sequences are useful when teaching how to perform an operational function.  The 
user can control the operational flow and observe the flight software responses.
The command parameters are hardcoded because sequences are written to support a 
specific project or lesson. 

Command sequence file syntax is very simple and the parser is very simple. Lines
beginning with a ‘>’ are commands that can be sent by the user. These lines are
extracted from the file and presented to the user in a scrollable window where
they can send each command. Each command line can have a comment that starts with
‘##’. This comment is displayed in a second window when the command is selected.
Comments should be written to help the user understand the expected behavior and
which telemetry points to use to verify the command behaved as expected. 

The command window also displays lines starting with '>#'. This allows comments
between groups of commands. Other conventions can be used to organize information
in a file like this file using """ as a file prologue delimiter and a === line to
delineate lessons. This are ignored by the parser.

To summarize the command window displays the following items. The dots are needed
here because to prevent the lines from being interpretted (remember it's simple):
.. ># Short comments introducing a group of commands that correspond to a lesson
.. > 'App_Name', 'Command', {dictionary of parameters} ## Comment shown in comment window

Only lines starting with ">" are interpreted as commands

'##' can't be part of a command or contained in a comment. It can only be used to start
a comment on a command line
