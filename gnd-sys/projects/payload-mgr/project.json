      "This project helps answer the common cFS question, 'How should I design a cFS app to manage",
      "a science payload?' There are multiple approaches towards solving this problem. This project",
      "is not intended to provide a survey of designs, rather it shows a specific design that you can",
      "evaluate within the context of your situation.\n",
      "A secondary objective is to show how a cFS library and application can be used to simulate a",
      "payload. This effective strategy lets you run your payload manager app prior to having a test",
      "configuration with the target hardware. It is also a flexible environment that lets you test",
      "error paths. See https://spacesteps.com/2024/10/12/cfs-payload-manager-app/ for details."
