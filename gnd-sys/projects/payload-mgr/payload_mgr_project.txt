================================================================================
Exercise 1. Nominal Operations

># Nominal Operations
> 'PL_SIM', 'PowerOn', {}  ## Wait for PL_MGR status telemetry to indicate power state is Ready
> 'PL_MGR', 'StartSci', {} ## Wait for at least one science file to be created (~30 seconds). An event message is sent when each science file is created and closed.
> 'PL_MGR', 'StopSci', {}  ## Use the File Browser to transfer pl_sci_xxx.txt to the ground, right click to edit/view the file


================================================================================
Exercise 2. Anomalous Operations

># Anomalous Operations
> 'PL_SIM', 'SetFault', {}      ## Fault present is set in PL_SIM status telemetry and not in PL_MGR status telemetry because science is off
> 'PL_MGR', 'StartSci', {}      ## Wait for at least one science file to be created (~30 seconds) and note the filename so you observe the fault in the detector data
> 'PL_MGR', 'ResetDetector', {} ## Note the current filename because the fault will be cleared in the data 
> 'PL_MGR', 'StopSci', {}       ## Use the File Browser to transfer the corrupted science data and post detector reset nominal science data
