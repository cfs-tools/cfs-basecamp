"""
This demo command sender file serves as a template for user command files. Command
files are a list of commands that are individually sent by the user. They are
a substitute for command scripts that would send commands and provide mechanisms
for automated command execution verification using telemetry. 

Command sender files are useful in lessons when mutiple commands need to be sent
and when command parameters are set based on the needs of a lesson. The user 
controls the operational flow and observes the flight software responses. The
default command parameters support a specific project or lesson, however users
can optionally edit parameters prior to sending a command. 

The command examples below support teh Demo App lesson that is part of the Basecamp
introduction tutorial. 

Command sender file syntax is very simple and the parser is very simple. Lines
beginning with a ‘>’ are commands that can be sent by the user. These lines are
extracted from the file and presented to the user in a scrollable window where
they can send each command. Each command line can have a comment that starts with
‘##’. This comment is displayed in a second window when the command is selected.
Comments should be written to help the user understand the expected behavior and
which telemetry points to use to verify the command behaved as expected. 

The command window also displays lines starting with '>#'. This allows comments
between groups of commands. Other conventions can be used to organize information
in a file like this file using """ as a file prologue delimiter and a === line to
delineate lessons. These types of lines are ignored by the parser.

To summarize the command window displays the following items. The dots are needed
here to prevent the lines from being interpretted (remember it's simple):
.. ># Short comments introducing a group of commands that correspond to a lesson
.. > 'App_Name', 'Command', {dictionary of parameters} ## Comment shown in comment window

Only lines starting with ">" are interpreted as commands

'##' can't be part of a command or contained in a comment. It can only be used to start
a comment on a command line
