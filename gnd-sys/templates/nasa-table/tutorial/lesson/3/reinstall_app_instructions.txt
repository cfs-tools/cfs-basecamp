This is not a source file that needs modification. These are special target 
instructions for this lesson. This lesson is unique because the NASA_TABLE
app needs to be reinstalled before the target is rebuilt. This is achieved
by

1. File->Remove User App from Target
   - Select nasa_table app
   - Select option to not remove source files

2. File->Add User App to Target
   - Select nasa_table and select the green buttons to install the app,
     rebuild the target and restart the GUI. 

The app is reinstalled because this lesson added a Topic ID for the table
proxy telemetry message. See the NASA_TABLE Tutorial Document for more details.
